Hi there, welcome to my Github :)

I am Miriam (she/her)

- I am currently furthering my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks
- I like working with python and C++
- :fireworks: I like trying out new things, like trying puzzles in new languages in ([Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/profile/983b2280e1dc93aa0999d9bdd39b0c61247199)) or Entwicklerheld.de.
- ðŸŽ„ This December I will join the Advent of Code on TryHackMe, in October I participated in The Huntress CTF
- :bulb: I love automating things, especially my home. My favorite automation ever is my custom sunrise, that wakes me every morning with all the lights in my bedroom.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology and went on to rock it as the IT department of a medical lab where I wrote workflows in Molis and Python to automate the boring stuff. While at parental leave I started studying again and am now working towards a masters in Practical Informatics.
